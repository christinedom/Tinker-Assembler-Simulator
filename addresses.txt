1) find what directive your in: Code or Data
2) Start at address 0
3) Ignore comments -> they add 0 address
4) Assign to a label the next address similar to what would happen with a instruction, but when the next instruction comes, dont add from the label address
5) If its an instruction, add the 4 if the previous instruction was in .code
    add 8 if the previous instruction was in .data
    keep the same value if the previous item was a label
